The interviewer was even kind enough to throw me a hint about projections. To my chagrin, I couldn't figure it out even then and had to admit I was stumped. To rub salt in my wounds, I knew that I was taught the mathematics behind PCA during the first year of my Master's course. So here's a post to make sure that doesn't happen to you, dear reader, and hopefully me as well.  "

However, the points on the two lines / vectors were just extended. That's because they're special vectors with respect to this transformation (with respect to this matrix). These two vectors are the eigenvectors of the matrix, as multiplying them by the matrix given only changes their magnitude and not their direction.

    "Observe that we get way more amenable projected values when we choose to standardize despite having features in several different scales. PCA is sensitive to the scale of the features entered, so standardizing ensures that we do not assign higher importance to larger features. Standardizing also helps you avoid overflow errors, i.e. numbers that are too large to be represented by your selected datatype. Typically, to standardize you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. \n",

This is where we're dividing everything by the standard deviation. $\\mathbf{P}_n$ is the projection matrix. $\\mathbf{X}$ is the original data. $\\overline{\\mathbf{X}}$ is the mean of the original data. The two forms are equivalent, we just need to change the order based on the shape of matrix. Standard deviation is the root of the variance, so the division by the square root of the eigenvalue matrix (diagonal matrix) or multiplication by the negative half power, is the same as dividing by the standard deviation. In essence, we're just standardizing the data for the reasons we demonstrated in code."

I believe that most PCA implementations nowadays use SVD instead of eigenvalue decompositions since SVD can work even with matrices that have repeated eigenvalues. You could learn about SVD."
