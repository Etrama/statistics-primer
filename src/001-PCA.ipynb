The interviewer was even kind enough to throw me a hint about projections. To my chagrin, I couldn't figure it out even then and had to admit I was stumped. To rub salt in my wounds, I knew that I was taught the mathematics behind PCA during the first year of my Master's course. So here's a post to make sure that doesn't happen to you, dear reader, and hopefully me as well.  "

However, the points on the two lines / vectors were just extended. That's because they're special vectors with respect to this transformation (with respect to this matrix). These two vectors are the eigenvectors of the matrix, as multiplying them by the matrix given only changes their magnitude and not their direction.

    "In the cell above, we define a PCA function. To compute the covariance matrix, instead of using np.cov(X, rowvar=False), we use the formula for covariance just for practice. The dot product method is kinda neat, but it run in numerical instabilities (read as divide by zero errors). So overall, you might wanna stick to np.cov(X, rowvar=False). But anyway to explain the dot product - X is $(m,n)$ and we need a $(n,n)$ covariance matrix. We need to multiply every value in X by every other value in X and sum the results. This is the same as multiplying X by its transpose. The transpose of X, X.T is $(n,m)$. The dot product of transpose of X and X is $(n,m)$ x $(m,n)$ = $(n,n)$ . We divide by X.shape[0] to get the mean. Let's try compute PCA with and without standardization:"

The two forms are equivalent, we just need to change the order based on the shape of matrix.
